            <h3>C++</h3>
            <h5>cout<<"Hello World";</h5>
                    <p><strong>C++</strong> is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an
                        enhancement of the C
                        language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.
                        C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers,
                        kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.).

            <h3>C</h3>
            <h5>printf("Hello World");</h5>
            <p><strong>C</strong> is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie
                in the year
                1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The
                main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a
                clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating
                system or compiler development</p>

            <h3>PYTHON</h3>
            <h5>print("Hello World")</h5>
            <p><strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language.
                Python programming
                language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along
                with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well
                suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and
                Java.</p>

            <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
            <h5>console.log("Hello World")</h5>
            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It
                is well-known for
                the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
                Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. </p>

            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <h5>echo "Hello World!";</h5>
            <p><strong>PHP</strong> is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
                PHP can be easily
                embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file. The thing that
                differentiates PHP from a client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server
                whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser.</p>

            <h3>MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
            <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn
                without being
                explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come
                across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans:
                The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places
                than one would expect.</p>

            <h3>DATA STRUCTURES &<br>ALGORITHMS</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Data structure</strong> is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can
                be used
                effectively.<br><strong>Algorithm</strong> refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step
                define how a work
                is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p><strong>HTML</strong> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a
                markup language.
                HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web
                pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure
                of web pages.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to
                make it
                attractive. The reason for using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS
                allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of
                the HTML that makes up each web page.</p>
